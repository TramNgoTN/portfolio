I have been loving to work with Datas.
In my Freshmen Summer (2025), I finished 4 small projects on Data Analytics including Data Exploring (SQL), Data Cleaning(SQL), Data Visualization(Tableau) and Finding Correlation(Python).
I finished the Intro to Programming Course: CS50P, learned SQL queries (including CTEs, Stored Procedure, View, Rollup, etc.) through CFI courses.

In the same summer of 2025, I also have some experience learning Data Analyzing and Data Visualization with Excel Tables. I had a chance to learn through CGV Sales & Marketing Department's Data (the movie chain in Asia). This experience helped me understanding the operation of the company as well as its performance in recent year.

I also had an eight-week internship at Vietinbank. With some understanding of Finance and Accouting, I have been helping with the materials (calculating ratios, arranging information) to contribute to the process of finding credible partners.
