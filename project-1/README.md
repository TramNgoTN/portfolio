# Data Exploration
In this Project, I used SQL to gain information about the data.

The dataset includes Covid Vaccinations and Deaths Datas from all over the world, in 2020-2021.
While Covid Deaths Data show the number of new cases by days, Covid Vaccination Data entails relating information about new cases (age, country GDP, gender, diabetes, etc.)

This project not only suggests the situation in 2020-2021, but also want to figure out the correlation of Covid cases and other factors (diseases, age, gender, etc.)
