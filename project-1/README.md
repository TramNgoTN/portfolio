# Data Exploration
The project depicts the situation when the Pandemic happened: death rate, infection rate, countries with highest rate, global rate, etc.

The dataset includes Covid Vaccinations and Deaths Datas from all over the world, in 2020-2021.
While Covid Deaths Data show the number of new cases by days, Covid Vaccination Data entails relating information about new cases (age, country GDP, gender, diabetes, etc.)

I used SQL to gain information about the data. Some queries used are CTEs, INNER JOIN, VIEW, PARTITION BY.
