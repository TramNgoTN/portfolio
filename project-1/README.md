# Data Exploration
In this Project, I used SQL to gain information about the data.

The dataset includes Covid Vaccinations and Deaths Datas from all over the world, in 2020-2021.
While Covid Deaths Data show the number of new cases by days, Covid Vaccination Data entails relating information about new cases (age, country GDP, gender, diabetes, etc.)
