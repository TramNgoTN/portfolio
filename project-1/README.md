# Data Exploration
In this Project, I used SQL to gain information about the data. Some queries used are CTES, INNER JOIN, VIEW, PARTITION BY.

The dataset includes Covid Vaccinations and Deaths Datas from all over the world, in 2020-2021.
While Covid Deaths Data show the number of new cases by days, Covid Vaccination Data entails relating information about new cases (age, country GDP, gender, diabetes, etc.)

The project helped depicting the situation when the Pandemic happened: death rate, infection rate, countries with highest rate, global rate, etc.
