# Correlation
The dataset includes information about a variety of movies: budget, gross earnings. duration, production company, votes, etc.

In this project, I want to find the correlation between Movie Budget and Gross Earnings(1); Production Company and Gross Earnings(2).
I assume that there are positive correlations.

I used libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.

Using scatterplot and heatmap, it was shown that there was a strong positive correlations between Movie Budget and Gross Earnings, Votes and Gross Earnings.
Meanwhile, there was no significant correlation between Production Company and Gross Earnings.
